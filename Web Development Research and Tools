Hey guys,

Here is the link that I mentioned that will help us learn almost everything we need to when it comes to learning about
web development.

You have to make an account, but if you already have a Microsoft account (which everyone should, because 
Windows 8, duh!) then your Microsoft account will suffice. I've used this before and they really have good tutorials and things
to practice. 

This is a "challenge" but pretty much all you need to do is spend one hour a day and you should have Web Development pretty 
much mastered by end of February. If we're short on schedule we can always learn ahead, or the individual themselves can always
learn ahead.  I plan on learning ahead as much as I can due to the time constraints with the project and who knows what more we
will have to do after the web app is set up.

The total amount of time it will require to watch all of the videos and learn the material is about 32 hours, so
it's not too bad and we should be able to do it even before the months end. But I know we all have lots going on with other
classes so I think we should aim for the end of February maybe.


If you guys find anything that is better, or noteworthy please let the whole group know so that we can learn it all together!
I think this is better than getting a book from the library and reading through it, so I think it will be useful for all of us.
